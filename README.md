# Blender-Texture-Swap---DDS-to-PNG

- Description

Short:
As the name suggests, it swaps the .dds textures in a Blender project with .png textures.

Long:
It's my first python code.

It has an Options sections.
The most relevant ones are subfolder and RemoveDDSs.
To swap the textures, first use an external software like "Photoshop's Image Processor PRO" to batch process and convert all dds textures to png.
Changing the name of the png variant to something different will result in a script error.
This fisrt version, does not convert the textures and also does not check if the png variant.

I decided to create this script while edditing some models that had dds textures and for some reason, sometimes DDS files do not load in my Blender.
